# Project Rules Base (AI Context-Owned)

This file is AI Context-owned and updated by AI Context upgrades.
Project-specific policy belongs in `project.rules.md`.

## 1) Source Of Truth
- `.ai-context/` is the shared source of truth across Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, and workspace agents.
- Agent-specific files (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`, `.agent/rules/*.md`) must stay thin and must not duplicate shared governance text.

## 2) Instruction Priority
Apply instructions in this order:
1. System/developer/runtime constraints
2. User request for the current session
3. This file and other `.ai-context/standards/*` files
4. Agent-specific adapter files

If instructions conflict, follow the highest-priority source and state assumptions briefly.

## 3) Clarification And Autonomy Policy
- Proceed without asking when requirements are clear and the change is low risk.
- Ask the user before proceeding when ambiguity could materially change behavior, cost, security, data integrity, or production impact.
- If blocked, ask one concise question and propose a default option to keep momentum.

## 4) High-Risk Action Confirmation (Required)
Require explicit user confirmation before:
- Destructive data/file actions (for example: `rm -rf`, irreversible deletes, force resets)
- Production-impacting deploy/config changes
- Database schema/data migrations in non-local environments
- Security/authentication/authorization policy changes
- Large dependency/platform upgrades with broad blast radius

When asking for confirmation, state:
1. what will change,
2. why it is needed,
3. rollback/mitigation plan if available.

## 5) Session Start (Required)
Before coding, read:
1. `.ai-context/project.overview.md`
2. `.ai-context/project.tasks.md`
3. `.ai-context/project.structure.md`
4. Recent files in `.ai-context/sessions/`
5. Relevant standards in `.ai-context/standards/`

## 6) Working Loop
1. Plan the smallest safe change that satisfies the request.
2. Implement incrementally.
3. Run relevant tests/checks.
4. Update context files when project state changes.
5. Summarize outcomes, verification, and remaining risks.

### Plans — When Required
Write a plan to `.ai-context/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md` (use `_template.md`) before starting work that is any of:
- Multi-session (expected to span more than one working session)
- Architectural change (new module, new data model, schema change, dependency upgrade with blast radius)
- External dependency integration (new third-party API, new CLI, new infrastructure component)
- Security-sensitive change (auth, permissions, secrets handling)

Reference the plan from `project.tasks.md` so it's discoverable. Small fixes, typos, and one-file changes don't need a plan.

## 7) Response Contract By Task Type
### Implementation/Change Tasks
- Lead with result.
- Include changed files and key commands.
- State verification performed (tests/lint/build) and what was not run.
- Mention any residual risk or follow-up.

### Code Review Tasks
- Findings first, ordered by severity.
- Include file and line references.
- Keep summary brief and secondary.
- Explicitly state if no findings were identified.

### Incident/Debug Tasks
- State impact, root cause (or current hypothesis), and mitigation status.
- Include reproduction/verification steps.
- List next actions with owners or clear handoff notes.

## 8) Context Update Rules
Route each state change to the correct `.ai-context/` file:
- New architectural decision → `project.decisions.md`
- User-visible change → `project.changelog.md`
- Task transition (new/in-progress/done/blocked) → `project.tasks.md`
- Plan authored → `plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`
- Session close → `sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`

## 9) Session Logging (Mandatory)
Every meaningful work session must create or update a session note.

### What Counts As A Session
- Any task that reads, searches, reviews, edits, or runs commands against repository files.
- Code review, proofreading, investigation, and documentation updates count as sessions when they use repo context.
- Pure conversational Q&A with no repository access is the only default exemption.

### Session File Naming
- Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`
- Example: `2026-02-17-template-normalization.md`
- If multiple sessions on same topic/day, append suffix: `YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-02.md`

### Session Location
- `.ai-context/sessions/`

### Session Template
- Use `.ai-context/sessions/_template.md`

### Update-Existing Behavior
- If a relevant session note already exists for the same day/topic, update it instead of creating duplicate logs.

### Timestamp Standard
- Use ISO 8601-style values:
  - Date: `YYYY-MM-DD`
  - Time: `HH:MM:SS`

## 10) Quality Gates
- Do not intentionally commit untested code.
- Keep changes focused and reversible.
- Do not commit secrets or credentials.
- Remove debug-only code before finalizing.

## 11) Git Workflow
See `.ai-context/standards/project.workflow.base.md` and `.ai-context/standards/project.workflow.md`.

## 12) Multi-Agent Handoffs
Assume another agent continues your work later.
- Be explicit in session notes.
- Record key decisions and rationale.
- Leave actionable next steps.
