# ai-context Architecture

`ai-context` solves a single problem: **coding agents lose context when you switch between them or start a new session.** This document explains how the tool works end-to-end — the file layout it imposes, how agents consume it, and how the CLI operates on it.

For usage, see the [README](../README.md). This doc is for contributors and for readers who want to understand the design before adopting the tool.

```

**Principles encoded in this diagram:**

- **One shared directory**, not per-agent configs. `.ai-context/` is the authoritative state.
- **Thin adapters**. Agent-specific files contain pointers, not content. Keeps context windows clean.
- **Hooks are invisible glue**. Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex hooks fire automatically to preserve context on compaction; users don't invoke them.
- **The CLI is orthogonal**. Agents work without the CLI once installed. The CLI is only for install, maintenance (drift, compact), and removal.

## Install / upgrade flow

Running `ai-context init` (or the non-interactive `ai-context apply`) walks through a backup-then-copy-then-restore pipeline designed to never destroy user content.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[user runs ai-context init] --> B{existing<br/>.ai-context/<br/>manifest.json?}
  B -->|no| C[apply_mode = fresh-install]
  B -->|yes| D{incoming version ==<br/>existing version?}
  D -->|yes| E[apply_mode = reapply]
  D -->|no| F[apply_mode = upgrade]

  C --> G[no backup needed]
  E --> H
  F --> H[backup MANAGED_PATHS<br/>to .ai-context-backups/ts/<br/>with preserveTimestamps]

  G --> I[copy template files<br/>→ target project]
  H --> I

  I --> J[install selected-agent hooks<br/>Claude settings.json<br/>Cursor hooks.json<br/>Codex hooks.json + config.toml]
  J --> K[restore project-owned files<br/>from backup by ownership pattern<br/>with preserveTimestamps]
  K --> L[write updated manifest.json<br/>version, schema, previous_version]
  L --> M[run setup prompt via<br/>detected CLI claude / cursor / codex]
  M --> N[write install log to<br/>.ai-context/logs/install/ts.md]
  N --> O[write setup log to<br/>.ai-context/logs/setup/ts.md]
```

**Key properties:**

- **Every run is recoverable.** Backups land in `.ai-context-backups/<timestamp>/` before any overwrite.
- **Additive hook merge.** The installer adds missing hook events without touching hooks the user owns. Claude settings, Cursor hooks, and Codex hooks are all merged rather than blindly overwritten.
- **Ownership-based restore.** `project.overview.md` (project-owned) is restored from backup; `project.rules.base.md` (tool-owned) is not. See [File ownership model](#file-ownership-model) below.
- **Timestamps preserved.** `fs.cp` runs with `preserveTimestamps: true` in both backup and restore so session-log age tracking survives upgrades. Without this, `ai-context compact` would see every file as brand new after each upgrade.

---

## Agent session lifecycle

Every agent that reads `.ai-context/` follows the same tiered protocol on session start, and the same end-of-session writeback discipline.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant User
  participant Agent as Claude / Cursor / Codex
  participant Ctx as .ai-context/

  User->>Agent: start session

  rect rgb(235, 245, 255)
    note over Agent,Ctx: Session start — tiered reads (always)
    Agent->>Ctx: read project.overview.md
    Agent->>Ctx: read project.changelog.md
    Agent->>Ctx: read latest sessions/*.md<br/>(excluding _archive/ and autosaves)
  end

  User->>Agent: task (code / refactor / review)

  rect rgb(255, 245, 230)
    note over Agent,Ctx: On-demand reads — based on task type
    Agent->>Ctx: standards/project.rules.{base,}.md<br/>(when writing code)
    Agent->>Ctx: project.tasks.md + plans/<br/>(when planning non-trivial work)
    Agent->>Ctx: project.structure.md<br/>(when navigating the tree)
  end

  Agent->>User: response / code changes

  rect rgb(235, 255, 235)
    note over Agent,Ctx: Session end — writebacks
    Agent->>Ctx: sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md (new log)
    Agent->>Ctx: project.tasks.md (status updates)
    Agent->>Ctx: project.decisions.md (new ADR)
    Agent->>Ctx: project.changelog.md (release-notes entry)
  end
```

**Why tiered, not all-at-once:** agents have finite context windows. Loading every standards file up front would consume the budget that should go toward the actual code and conversation. The tiered protocol front-loads orientation (always-read) and defers everything else to on-demand reads based on the current task.

### Three project files, three time horizons

The "Always-read" list includes `project.overview.md` and `project.changelog.md` but **not** `project.tasks.md` or `project.backlog.md`. That's deliberate — each file serves a different time horizon:

| File | Horizon | What it holds | Update cadence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `project.tasks.md` | **Now** — active work | In-progress, blocked, next-up. Concrete and actionable. | Often (per-session) |
| `project.backlog.md` | **Later** — ideas pipeline | Deferred work, feature ideas, tech debt. Not yet ready to start. | Occasionally (when grooming) |
| `project.changelog.md` | **Past** — shipped history | Immutable record of releases, organized by version. User-visible changes only. | On release boundaries |

The lifecycle of an idea flows in one direction: `backlog.md` → (when work begins) `tasks.md` → (when done) possibly `changelog.md` under a version heading.

For session-start orientation the tool picks `changelog.md` + `latest sessions/*.md` rather than `tasks.md` because:

- **`changelog.md` is a stable anchor.** It describes what the project *is* at this moment — which features shipped, which fixes landed. Entries don't change after they're written, so it never misleads.
- **`tasks.md` is volatile.** A stale "In Progress" marker can give the agent a wrong picture of what's actually happening. It's authoritative when you're planning, not when you're orienting.
- **The latest session log is where the "right now" view lives.** Its `Next Steps` section is typically the freshest snapshot of active work — written minutes before the previous session ended, by the agent that was doing the work.

So the session-start triad covers three horizons without needing to read every file: overview (what this project is) + changelog (what has shipped) + latest session (what was just happening). `tasks.md` and `backlog.md` move to the on-demand tier and are read when the user's request is explicitly about planning or queueing work.

### "Latest file in sessions/" — it's literally one file

The adapter rule says "latest file in `sessions/` (excluding `_archive/`)" — emphasis on **file**, singular. Agents never scan the whole sessions folder at session start; they pick the single most-recently-modified non-archive, non-autosave log. For a mature project with 100+ session files, scanning all of them would blow out the context window.

This is why `ai-context compact` exists: it archives old sessions into `sessions/_archive/YYYY-MM-rollup.md` so the set of candidates for "latest" stays small and fresh. The `_archive/` folder's README tells agents not to read it at session start (and the `sessions/` glob excludes it explicitly). So the always-read load stays bounded: one overview + one changelog + one session log, no matter how big the project grows.

### Which writebacks are mandatory

A new session log and updated task status happen every session. `project.decisions.md` gets a new ADR only when the session made a non-trivial architectural choice worth explaining later. `project.changelog.md` gets an entry only for changes a downstream consumer of the project would care about (new features, user-visible fixes, breaking changes) — internal refactors don't belong there. Agents are expected to judge each case; when in doubt, err toward logging.

---

## Context-preservation flow (Claude Code hooks)

Claude Code's context window compacts when it fills up — either automatically near the token limit, or manually via `/compact`. Compaction is lossy by nature: the agent receives a summary, not the full transcript. `ai-context` installs two hooks that turn compaction into a safe, automatic checkpoint.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant User
  participant Claude as Claude Code
  participant PC as pre-compact.sh<br/>(PreCompact hook)
  participant FS as .ai-context/<br/>sessions/
  participant PCR as post-compact-<br/>reminder.sh<br/>(SessionStart hook)

  User->>Claude: /compact<br/>or auto-compact triggers

  rect rgb(255, 240, 220)
    note over Claude,PC: PreCompact hook fires
    Claude->>PC: spawn with JSON on stdin<br/>(transcript_path, trigger)
    PC->>FS: write YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-<br/>precompact-autosave.md<br/>+ transcript excerpt via jq
    PC-->>Claude: exit 0 (never blocks)
  end

  Claude->>Claude: compact context<br/>(summarize, drop oldest)

  rect rgb(220, 240, 255)
    note over Claude,PCR: SessionStart(compact) hook fires
    Claude->>PCR: spawn on fresh post-compact session
    PCR->>FS: glob for *-precompact-autosave.md
    PCR-->>Claude: emit additionalContext<br/>"autosave exists — curate it"
  end

  Claude->>User: session continues, agent aware of autosave

  rect rgb(220, 255, 220)
    note over Claude,FS: Curation (in next agent turn)
    Claude->>FS: read the autosave file
    Claude->>FS: write sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md<br/>(curated session log)
    Claude->>FS: delete the autosave
  end
```

**Design decisions:**

- **Both manual and auto triggers run the same path.** An earlier design blocked manual `/compact` to force a session log first; that friction wasn't worth it. The autosave captures context regardless of trigger.
- **Post-compaction reminder uses the best channel each agent exposes.** Claude uses `SessionStart(compact)` with `additionalContext`; Cursor uses `sessionStart`; Codex uses `PostCompact` and also keeps `SessionStart` as a leftover-autosave safety net.
- **Autosaves preserve a breadcrumb, not the durable record.** The autosave stores a `local_transcript_ref` pointer to the local transcript JSONL and, when possible, a recent-turn excerpt. The post-compact session should copy `source_autosave` and `local_transcript_ref` into the curated session log before deleting the autosave, so exact prior discussion remains recoverable locally if the compacted summary missed a critical detail. Older autosaves may use the legacy field name `transcript_ref`; curators should normalize that to `local_transcript_ref`. Hooks write the path home-relative when possible, but because `local_transcript_ref` is still local/private, teams that commit or share session logs may redact it.
- **Graceful `jq` degradation.** If `jq` isn't installed, the autosave still writes a stub with a pointer to the transcript JSONL path. Context isn't lost even in minimal environments.

## Drift detection (`check-drift`) and auto-apply (`--fix`)

`.ai-context/` can drift from the actual codebase as the project evolves. `check-drift` detects drift in two layers and optionally applies patches.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  A[ai-context check-drift<br/>--fix=significant] --> B[Layer 1 — static checks<br/>local, fast, no LLM]
  B --> B1[broken refs in<br/>project.structure.md]
  B --> B2[stale overview<br/>last_updated vs git log]
  B --> B3[stale In-Progress tasks<br/>no commits in 14 days]
  B --> B4[backlog items > 90 days old]

  B1 & B2 & B3 & B4 --> C[Layer 2 — LLM analysis<br/>via claude -p]
  C --> D[agent reads overview +<br/>structure + decisions +<br/>git log --stat -n 50 + tree]
  D --> E[agent produces structured<br/>report with severity tags<br/>significant / moderate / minor]
  E --> F[write to<br/>.ai-context/logs/drift/<br/>ts-drift.md]

  F --> G{--fix flag?}
  G -->|no| H[done — terminal shows path]
  G -->|yes| I[Phase 2 — apply]
  I --> J[second claude -p invocation<br/>reads the report file]
  J --> K[agent applies patches at or<br/>above --fix severity cutoff]
  K --> L[agent reports<br/>files edited + skipped]
```

**Severity cutoff semantics:**

| Flag | Applies |
|---|---|
| `--fix` (default) | `[significant]` only |
| `--fix=significant` | `[significant]` only |
| `--fix=moderate` | `[significant]` + `[moderate]` |
| `--fix=minor` | everything |
| `--fix=all` | everything (alias for `minor`) |

**Why file-first:** storing the report to disk lets `--fix` (Phase 2) read it deterministically, lets users re-run just the apply step later, and provides an audit trail. Without a file, users had to copy-paste ~200-line reports from terminal scrollback into a fresh session to apply anything.

---

## Session compaction flow

Session logs accumulate. After months of use, there can be hundreds — too many for "read the latest session" to remain useful. `compact` archives old sessions into a single rollup and deletes the originals.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A[ai-context compact<br/>--older-than 30<br/>--keep 10] --> B[scan<br/>.ai-context/sessions/]
  B --> C[exclude _template.md +<br/>precompact-autosave +<br/>_archive/]
  C --> D[sort by mtime<br/>newest → oldest]
  D --> E[always preserve<br/>newest --keep files]
  E --> F[filter remaining<br/>by > --older-than days]
  F --> G{matches?}
  G -->|none| H[exit<br/>nothing to archive]
  G -->|yes| I[build rollup prompt<br/>source list + template +<br/>deletion instructions]
  I --> J[agent via claude -p]
  J --> K[agent reads each session]
  K --> L[agent writes<br/>sessions/_archive/<br/>YYYY-MM-rollup.md]
  L --> M[agent deletes source files]
  M --> N[write compact log to<br/>logs/compact/ts.md]
```

**The rollup is structured, not a dump.** The prompt instructs the agent to extract (not copy) three classes of preserved content:

- Decisions carried forward (still in effect)
- Open threads at end of range (unresolved work)
- File/area knowledge (non-obvious context about specific files)

Source sessions are then deleted. Rollup file has `archived: true` frontmatter and the `_archive/` folder's README tells agents not to read it at session start — so rollups are reference material, not current state.

---

## File ownership model

Every file under `.ai-context/` is either **tool-owned** (shipped by `ai-context`, replaced on upgrade) or **project-owned** (your content, preserved across upgrades).

| Path | Ownership | On upgrade |
|---|---|---|
| `.ai-context/manifest.json` | Tool | Rewritten with new version/schema metadata |
| `.ai-context/README.md` | Tool | Replaced with new version |
| `.ai-context/project.overview.md.template` | Tool | Replaced (fallback for `project.overview.md`) |
| `.ai-context/standards/project.rules.base.md` | Tool | Replaced |
| `.ai-context/standards/project.workflow.base.md` | Tool | Replaced |
| `.ai-context/standards/README.md` | Tool | Replaced |
| `.ai-context/sessions/_template.md` | Tool | Replaced |
| `.ai-context/sessions/_archive/README.md` | Tool | Replaced |
| `.ai-context/plans/_template.md` | Tool | Replaced |
| `.ai-context/logs/README.md` | Tool | Replaced |
| `.ai-context/project.overview.md` | Project | Restored from backup |
| `.ai-context/project.tasks.md` | Project | Restored from backup |
| `.ai-context/project.decisions.md` | Project | Restored from backup |
| `.ai-context/project.changelog.md` | Project | Restored from backup |
| `.ai-context/project.backlog.md` | Project | Restored from backup |
| `.ai-context/project.structure.md` | Project | Restored from backup |
| `.ai-context/standards/project.rules.md` | Project | Restored from backup |
| `.ai-context/standards/project.workflow.md` | Project | Restored from backup |
| `.ai-context/standards/project.<lang>.md` | Project | Restored from backup (created by `init` setup prompt on first install) |
| `.ai-context/sessions/*.md` | Project | Restored from backup |
| `.ai-context/plans/*.md` | Project | Restored from backup |
| `.ai-context/sessions/_archive/*.md` | Project | Restored from backup |
| Any other custom file under `.ai-context/**` | Project | Restored from backup |

The **restore logic** (`restoreProjectOwnedFiles` in `packages/cli/src/core/restore.ts`) walks the backup tree, checks each file against `isAiContextOwned()`, and restores any that aren't tool-owned. Custom files users add (e.g., their own `project.typescript.md` or domain-specific context files) are preserved by default — no explicit allowlist needed.

---

## Hook source of truth

Hook behavior is split between script templates and generated configuration:

| Artifact | Source of truth | Packaged/installed behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Claude hook scripts | `.claude/hooks/*.sh` at repo root | `scripts/sync-templates.sh` copies them to `packages/cli/src/templates/claude/hooks/`; `installClaudeHooks()` copies scripts and merges `.claude/settings.json` |
| Cursor hook scripts | `.cursor/hooks/*.sh` at repo root | `scripts/sync-templates.sh` copies them to `packages/cli/src/templates/cursor/hooks/`; `copyTemplates()` installs scripts and `installCursorHooks()` writes/merges `.cursor/hooks.json` |
| Codex hook scripts | `.codex/hooks/*.sh` at repo root | `scripts/sync-templates.sh` copies them to `packages/cli/src/templates/codex/hooks/`; `copyTemplates()` installs scripts and `installCodexHooks()` writes/merges `.codex/hooks.json` and `.codex/config.toml` |

Generated hook config files are intentionally not template-owned for Cursor and Codex. `scripts/sync-templates.sh` removes `cursor/hooks.json`, `codex/hooks.json`, and `codex/config.toml` from the package template tree so upgrades can merge into a user's existing config instead of overwriting it.

Codex project-level hooks live under the project's `.codex/` layer and are loaded for trusted projects, but project trust and hook trust are separate. After `.codex/hooks.json` is added or changed, run `/hooks` inside Codex for that project and trust the AI Context entries. Codex stores trust per hook hash in `~/.codex/config.toml`; newly added or changed events such as `PreCompact` and `PostCompact` will not run until reviewed. If a Codex Desktop session was already running before `.codex/hooks.json` was added or changed, restart the app/session or re-open the project before reviewing the hooks.

---

## Command-level reference

All commands live in `packages/cli/src/commands/` and share a small set of core modules:

| Command | Primary logic | Log output |
|---|---|---|
| `init` / `apply` | `core/install.ts`, `core/copyTemplates.ts`, `core/claudeHooks.ts`, `core/cursorHooks.ts`, `core/codexHooks.ts`, `core/restore.ts` | `.ai-context/logs/install/` |
| `setup` | `core/setupFlow.ts`, `core/agentCLI.ts` | `.ai-context/logs/setup/` |
| `use` | `commands/useCli.ts`, `core/manifest.ts` | (none — terminal only) |
| `check-drift` | `commands/checkDrift.ts` + static checks inline | `.ai-context/logs/drift/` |
| `compact` | `commands/compact.ts` | `.ai-context/logs/compact/` |
| `uninstall` | `commands/uninstall.ts` | (none — terminal only) |
| `status` | `commands/status.ts` | (none — terminal only) |
| `version` | `commands/version.ts` | (none — terminal only) |

Shared primitives used by the LLM-driven commands (`setup`, `check-drift`, `compact`):

- **`core/agentCLI.ts`** — thin public barrel re-exporting the agent-CLI subsystem under `core/cli/`:
  `cli/types.ts` (CLIConfig + parser types), `cli/format.ts` (progress-label helpers),
  `cli/vendors/{claude,codex,cursor}.ts` (one module per CLI: command shape + stream parsers,
  the most vendor-volatile code, unit-tested via `tests/unit/cli/<vendor>-parser.test.ts`),
  `cli/registry.ts` (the `CLI_REGISTRY` + spec/progress accessors), `cli/detection.ts`
  (binary resolution + health checks), `cli/process.ts` (generic spawn), `cli/runner.ts`
  (streaming prompt execution). Adding/fixing a CLI touches only its `cli/vendors/<name>.ts`.
- **`core/clipboardFallback.ts`** — `executeOrCopy()` is the unified entry point. Tries the CLI first; on failure OR empty stdout, copies the prompt to clipboard with a clear paste hint. Does NOT fall back on permission denials alone — if stdout came through, the run counts as executed.
- **`core/logWriter.ts`** — `writeCommandLog({ category, content })` writes `.ai-context/logs/<category>/<iso-ts>.md`. Append-only across upgrades.
- **`prompts/`** — single home for all LLM prompts. Static prompts are `.md` (`prompts/setup/{fresh-install,upgrade}.md`, read at runtime); dynamic prompts are pure builder functions (`prompts/drift.ts`, `prompts/compact.ts`) that take gathered data and return strings — commands do the I/O, the prompt layer does not. Interactive (inquirer) CLI prompts are UI and live in `core/../ui/`, not here. See `src/prompts/README.md`.

**Configured CLI (`configured_cli`).** The CLI chosen during `setup` is persisted to `manifest.json` by `runSetup` (via `setConfiguredCli()`) and reused as the default for `setup`/`check-drift`/`compact` (resolved via `resolveConfiguredCli()`, which ignores a stored value no longer in the registry). It carries forward across upgrades (`core/install.ts`) and is changed independently with `ai-context use [cli]`. `--cli <name>` overrides it per run; `null` means auto-detect. It is distinct from `agents_installed` (which adapter files were written).

---

## Design principles

- **File system is the interop layer.** No daemon, no database, no cloud. Markdown files every agent and human can read, edit, grep, commit. The only stateful thing is the Claude Code transcript JSONL, and even that is a pointer (held in autosave files), not a copy.
- **Adapters are thin.** `CLAUDE.md` is one line (`@AGENTS.md`) plus a few Claude-specific notes. `AGENTS.md` is ~40 lines. Neither duplicates `.ai-context/` content. This keeps agents' context windows clean and makes the single-source-of-truth rule actually enforceable.
- **Tiered reading.** Always-read for orientation; on-demand reads for task-specific detail. Agents have finite context; this convention uses it efficiently.
- **Hooks, not humans, preserve context.** Session logging is mandatory by convention, but also backstopped by session-end reminders and PreCompact autosaves across Claude, Cursor, and Codex. Users get a working system even when their discipline slips.
- **Every action is reversible.** Backups before every install. Nested `.ai-context/.git/` supported (filter excludes it from backup/restore). All LLM-driven commands have clipboard fallback. See the [README's Safety & rollback section](../README.md#safety--rollback).
- **Ownership-based, not allowlist-based.** Project-owned files are identified by pattern, not enumerated. Custom files users add under `.ai-context/**` are preserved automatically.
- **Logs always persist.** Install, setup, drift, compact — every run writes a markdown log to `.ai-context/logs/<category>/`, regardless of outcome (executed, clipboard, printed, failed). Users can audit what the tool + their agents actually did.

---

## Extension: adding a new agent

To support a new coding agent:

1. **Add the adapter file.** A thin file pointing at `.ai-context/` in whatever format the agent expects (e.g. `.newagent/rules.md`). Mirror the tiered reading + end-of-session discipline from existing adapters.
2. **Register in `copyTemplates.ts`.** Add an entry to `AGENT_FILES` mapping the agent ID to its file(s), and to `TEMPLATE_TO_TARGET` for the path mapping.
3. **Add to `selectAgents()` in `prompts/agentSelector.ts`** so users can pick it during `init`.
4. **(Optional) Add CLI support.** If the agent has a headless CLI like `claude -p`, create `core/cli/vendors/<name>.ts` exporting a `CLIConfig` (ping/run args + stream parsers) and register it in `core/cli/registry.ts`. Add parser fixture tests under `tests/unit/cli/`. This enables `setup`, `check-drift`, `compact` to execute via that CLI instead of falling back to clipboard.

No changes to `.ai-context/` layout are needed — the whole directory is agent-agnostic by design.
